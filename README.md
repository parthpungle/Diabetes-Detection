## Diabetes-Detection
A machine learning project designed to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML skills: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

As a college student applying for internships, I built this project to strengthen my applied machine learning skills and gain experience working with real-world healthcare data.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This notebook develops a classification model that predicts diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The workflow covers:

Understanding and preprocessing medical datasets

Applying ML algorithms

Evaluating model performance

Interpreting feature importance

Presenting insights for potential clinical decision support

## KEY FEATURES

1)End-to-end ML pipeline in Python

2)Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)

3)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4)Comparison of multiple models

5)Confusion matrix + accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

6)Hyperparameter tuning

7)Final model deployment-ready pipeline
